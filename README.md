**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.


Countdown Adapter for ioBroker
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of the adapter is to provide you a possibility to run countdowns for future events, with years, months, days, hours and minutes. It will provide you each of those valies seperately, and also two strings with a short and long version of the date.
